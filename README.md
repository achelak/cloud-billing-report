# cloud-billing-report

Perl scripts that parse AWS and GCP billing data and generate an email report.
Written by Erich Weiler.

This repository was previously named ucsc-cgp/aws-billing-report. It was
renamed ucsc-cgp/cloud-billing-report to accomodate reporting scripts for both
AWS and GCP.

## Versions

Scripts are not explicitly versioned, but are tagged based on when they are
"released" to Erich for installation in format `report_type/YYYY-MM-DD`,
e.g. `aws/2020-08-11` or `gcp/1999-01-02`.
